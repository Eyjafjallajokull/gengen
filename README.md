# GenGen

This project aims to build 3d model using only 2d image as reference. It is impossible to make a real, accurate 3d model, what I'm trying to achieve is an *abstract* model. The result of an algoritm will be a model consiting of many triangles, looking at it from specified direction and with proper lighting should reveal base image. From any other direction model will look like randomly placed trinagles.

## How?

Using genetic algoritm with tournament selection.

## Example

* base image
* result image
* 3d model screen
* time, generations, renders, config
